# Obesity Classification Application

A web application that classifies a user's obesity level based on personal health data such as height, weight, age, and physical activity level. The system uses three machine learning models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. The model with the highest accuracy is automatically selected to provide the final classification result.
